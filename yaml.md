## Pauses

Pauses are accumulative and the given value is the minimal pause that will be
used. That is, even if a pause is defined as small, it can be longer in case the
preceding expression requires this. In case it is defined as medium or long than
the pause will be at least medium or long no matter how small the preceding
expression is.
